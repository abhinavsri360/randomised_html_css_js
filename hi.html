				<p id="heho">"Spiderwebs" received positive reviews from contemporary as well as past critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for No Doubt. "Spiderwebs" was not released as a commercial single in the United States, and therefore was ineligible to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the time of its release. However, it reached number 18 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song failed to attain top-ten positions, but charted within the top 40 in Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.</p>
			<h1 id="ee">Johnnie Walker</h1>
				<p id="hoho">Johnnie Walker is a brand of Scotch whisky now owned by Diageo that originated in the Scottish town of Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire. The brand was first established by grocer John Walker. It is the most widely distributed brand of blended Scotch whisky in the world, sold in almost every country, with annual sales of the equivalent of over 223.7 million 700 ml bottles in 2016 (156.6 million litres).[1]</p>

				<p id="hoi">John  Walker was born on 25 July 1805. His farmer father died in 1819, and the family sold the farm. Their trustees invested the proceeds, £417, in an Italian warehouse, grocery, and wine and spirits shop on the High Street in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland. Walker managed the grocery, wine, and spirits segment as a teenager in 1820. The Excise Act of 1823 relaxed strict laws on distillation of whisky and reduced, by a considerable amount, the extremely heavy taxes on the distillation and sale of whisky.[2] By 1825, Walker, a teetotaller, was selling spirits, including rum, brandy, gin, and whisky.[3]</p>
